# MK1Hook
A plugin for Mortal Kombat 1.

# Installation

**MK1Hook was only tested with latest Steam version!**

**60 FPS patch is now bundled in as an option with MK1Hook, if you wish to only download it, check https://github.com/ermaccer/MK160FPSPatch**


You can download binary files from [Releases](https://github.com/ermaccer/MK1Hook/releases) page. Extract **mk1hook.zip**
to MK12\Binaries\Win64 folder of Mortal Kombat 1 (so that **dsound.dll** ends up near **SDL2.dll**).

If you are not sure how to find your Mortal Kombat 1 folder, search for it in your Steam library then right click on the entry and select Manage->Browse local files.

# Usage

If installed correctly, a notification will appear informing that the plugin was installed
and is ready to use. By default **F1** will open or close in-game menu.

# Issues

- Changing game resolution will freeze the game with hook installed, ideally install the mod after setting game up.
